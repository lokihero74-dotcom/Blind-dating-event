2.  **The Waiting Room:** Participants wait until there is an even number of pairs.
3.  **The Shuffle:** The host (or the system) triggers a "Shuffle."
4.  **The Date:** Private chat spaces are created for each pair.
5.  **Rotation:** After the time limit, pairs are dissolved and everyone returns to the pool for a new match.
